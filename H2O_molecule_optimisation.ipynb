Therefore, the unoccupied (also called virtual) orbitals are basically a byproduct of the calculations. However, when styding the electronic properties of a system, it is common practise to look at the separation in energy between the HOMO (High Occupied Molecular Orbitals) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) to a first approximation."
