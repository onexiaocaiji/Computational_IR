    "\n",
    "The primary aim of this computational project is to identify a molecule from its measured vibrational spectrum.\n",
    "In doing this you will be developing skills that underpin any scientific study:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) formulating a hypothesis;\n",
    "\n",
    "2) designing a strategy to test this hypothesis (in this case using quantum-mechanical simulations);\n",
    "\n",
    "3) prove or refute the hypothesis assessing the degree of confidence of the result;\n",
    "\n",
    "4) drawing conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secondary aim of this computational module is to learn how to use a computational tool widely adopted in chemical research, Gaussian, to study vibrational properties.\n",
