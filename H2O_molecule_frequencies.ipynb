    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_{fi}=\\left.\\frac{d \\mu(x)}{dx}\\right|_{x=0} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\chi_f(x)\\ x \\ \\chi_i(x)dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu(x)$ is how the magnitude of the dipole moment changes with the displacement $x$ of the equilibrium position $(x=0)$, and $\\chi_f(x)$ and $\\chi_i(x)$ are the final and initial vibration functions. The derivative in front of the integral shows that the absorption intensity is higher if the displacement induces a bigger change in the dipole moment magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the above equation was derived for diatomics, it also applies for individual vibrational modes in polyatomic molecules, with $x$ being a displacement of a specific vibrational modes. Vibrational modes resulting in a bigger change in dipole moment magnitude will result in more intense peaks. Conversely, vibrational modes that preserve the symmetry of the molecule and do not result in a change in dipole moment will not have observed transitions in the infrared spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"Vibrations\" menu, you can click on \"Show Dipole Derivative Unit Vector\", which indicates how the dipole of the molecule changes as the molecule vibrates according to each vibrational mode. Note that the represented vector shows only the direction of the change and does not represent the magnitude of the change (unit vector). To plot the dipole moment itself (not the change), you can go to \"Results\" > \"Charge Distribution ...\" > \"Dipole Moment\".\n",
